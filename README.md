# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This assignment was based on third-party APIs. We were given a weather API and created a website that allows the user to search a city and then is provided with the current weather of that city as well as a 5 day forecast.

Unfortunately at this time, I was unsuccessful at fetching the website data and hope to revisit this assignment in the future to fix all my problems.

## Website
Here is a screenshot of how the website looks like:
